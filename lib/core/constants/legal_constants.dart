### Privacy Policy for Pocket LLM Lite

**Effective Date: August 03, 2026**

PocketLLM Lite performs AI inference locally by default and does not include behavioral analytics or advertising trackers. Chats remain on the device when using local inference. Optional online features, including model downloads, web search, update checks, remote Ollama servers, and GitHub skill installation, connect to external services only as described in the application’s Privacy & Network settings.

#### 1. Local Data Storage & Inference
- **Chat History & Personas:** All messages, prompt templates, personas, custom skills, and attached files are stored locally in sandbox Hive databases on your device.
- **Local Model Processing:** On-device GGUF inference and local Ollama server calls (`127.0.0.1:11434`) process all prompt content on your machine without transmitting text to external servers.

#### 2. Optional External Connections & User Consent
The application includes optional network capabilities, which are disabled or subject to explicit consent:
- **Automatic Update Checks:** Optional check via `api.github.com` for new APK releases. Disabled by default.
- **Hugging Face Model Discovery:** Model browsing and GGUF file downloads via `huggingface.co`. Triggered only when searching or downloading models.
- **Tavily Web Search:** Real-time search query execution via `api.tavily.com`. Sends the search query and user API key only when web search is enabled.
- **GitHub Skill Installation:** Downloading skill Markdown manifests from `raw.githubusercontent.com` upon user request.
- **Remote Ollama Endpoints:** Connecting to external or LAN-hosted Ollama servers. A prominent warning dialog requires explicit user confirmation before connecting to remote hosts.

#### 3. Voice and Image Processing
- **Image Processing:** Uploaded images for vision models are processed in-memory or converted locally to base64 strings attached to your local chat session.
- **Voice Features:** Speech-to-text and text-to-speech run via platform system services or local engines.

#### 4. Locally Stored Diagnostic Logs
- Crash reports, Flutter UI errors, and activity logs are stored locally in `error_logs` and `activity_logs` Hive boxes. No telemetry or log data is uploaded automatically.

#### 5. Data Deletion and User Retention
You retain complete control over all stored data. Clearing app history, deleting specific chats, or uninstalling the app permanently removes all local databases.

#### 6. External Domains List
When optional online features are activated, PocketLLM Lite may communicate with:
- `api.github.com` (Update checks)
- `huggingface.co` (Model discovery & binary downloads)
- `api.tavily.com` (Web search)
- `raw.githubusercontent.com` (Skill manifests)
- User-configured remote Ollama IPs/domains (Remote inference)

#### 7. User Controls & Strict Offline Mode
In **Settings > Privacy & Network Centre**, you can toggle **Strict Offline Mode** to block all non-loopback connections at application level.

# Release Notes - Version 1.0.34 (Memory & Document Workspace)

## **Highlights: Local Long-Term Memory, Hybrid RAG & Offline OCR**
This release delivers Phase 3 of our product roadmap, equipping PocketLLM Lite with persistent local memory, transparent memory inspection, an enterprise-grade document workspace, hybrid search with page citations, and offline OCR:
1. **Local Long-Term Memory & Sensitivity Shield**: Automatically extracts durable facts across 7 categories (*Personal Facts, Preferences, Projects, People, Goals, Writing Style, Reusable Instructions*) while suppressing sensitive credentials.
2. **Local Memory Inspector (`/settings/memory-inspector`)**: Interactive panel allowing users to view, search, edit, delete, pin, toggle, or manually create long-term memories.
3. **Hybrid Retrieval Engine & MMR**: Dense vector + BM25 hybrid search engine (`HybridRetrievalService`) with Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) deduplication preventing repetitive context injection.
4. **Multi-Document Workspace & Semantic Chunker**: RAG workspace (`DocumentWorkspaceService`) preserving page numbers, heading hierarchies, code blocks, and formatting inline page citations `[DocName.pdf, Page X]`.
5. **Offline Local OCR & Document Vision**: On-device text extraction service (`LocalOcrService`) for scanned PDFs, screenshots, whiteboards, forms, and receipts without external APIs.

## **Feature List**

### **🔍 Tavily Web Search (New!)**
*   **Real-time Web Search (`web_search` tool)**: Native integration with the Tavily Search API directly inside our `ToolCallingService` to query live web data.
*   **Web Search Toggle**: Conveniently toggle live search on and off directly from the chat input toolbar (`Icons.language_rounded`).
*   **API Key Verification**: Built-in verification dialog guiding the user to enter their Tavily API key in settings if they attempt to search without it.
*   **Premium Shimmer Bubble**: Shows a beautiful, dynamic `🔍 Searching the web...` shimmering bubble while fetching internet resources, keeping the UI alive and responsive.
*   **Inline Source Citations**: Conditions local LLMs to cite sources via standard, clickable inline markdown links `[Source Name](URL)` that launch automatically in external browsers.
*   **Secure API Configuration**: Dedicated settings field under "Web Search (Tavily)" to easily and safely enter, preview, and persist Tavily API credentials.

### **🧩 Agent Skills System (New!)**
*   **SKILL.md Standard Format**: Follows the standard YAML frontmatter and Markdown body architecture for clean, organized, and powerful domain-specific skills.
*   **GitHub Skill Installer**: Easily download, preview, and install custom skills from any standard or raw GitHub repository URL, with automatic blob link conversion.
*   **Full CRUD & Status Toggles**: Create, read, update, and delete agent skills manually with sleek modal sheets. Easily toggle individual skills on or off using M3 switches.
*   **Smart Autocomplete Suggester**: As you type `/` in the chat input, a horizontal M3 selection panel dynamically populates matching active skills.
*   **In-Input Rich Highlights & Tap-Redirects**: Skill triggers inside the input field are highlighted in bold primary blue. Tapping on a highlighted skill word instantly redirects you to the detailed skill instructions page.
*   **Inter-Bubble Clickable Badges**: preprocessed message content converts skill triggers into interactive markdown links in both user and assistant conversation bubbles. Tapping a badge takes you directly to the skill's instructions.
*   **Dynamic LLM Skill Conditioning**: Complete automatic scanning of active skill triggers inside user queries. When a skill is detected, its markdown body is dynamically injected into the system instructions for that turn.
